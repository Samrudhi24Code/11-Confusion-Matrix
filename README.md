# Confusion Matrix

This repository demonstrates the implementation and analysis of a **Confusion Matrix**, a crucial tool for evaluating the performance of classification models in machine learning. It provides insights into the accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score of a model by breaking down its predictions into true positives, false positives, true negatives, and false negatives.

## Overview
The **Confusion Matrix** is a table used to evaluate the performance of a classification algorithm by comparing predicted values with actual values. It is particularly useful for binary and multi-class classification problems.

### Components:
- **True Positive (TP)**: Correctly predicted positive observations.
- **False Positive (FP)**: Incorrectly predicted positive observations.
- **True Negative (TN)**: Correctly predicted negative observations.
- **False Negative (FN)**: Incorrectly predicted negative observations.

### Metrics Derived from the Confusion Matrix:
1. **Accuracy**: `(TP + TN) / (TP + FP + TN + FN)`
2. **Precision**: `TP / (TP + FP)`
3. **Recall (Sensitivity)**: `TP / (TP + FN)`
4. **F1-Score**: `2 * (Precision * Recall) / (Precision + Recall)`



## Features
- Compute confusion matrices for binary and multi-class classification.
- Calculate evaluation metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
- Visualize the confusion matrix using a heatmap.
